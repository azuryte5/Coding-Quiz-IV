# assignment4-quiz
* I need to build a quiz that has a start <button> (Function to begin game starts)
* When I press start the game begins (on click,start game)
A timer starts and begins ticking down (Function with interval)
First question is displayed and I am given four possible answers. 1 is correct and proceeds no penalty (cycle question Function)
hover elements show up, when an option selected is wrong or right answer appears
if the answer is correct the next question is displayed (Need to practice Java appearing on screen)
if the answer is wrong time is lost (loose interval)
the game is over if the questions are done or if timer is 0 (End game function)
score is the time left at end of game
score is logged and option to add initals to score
score is saved, with option to clear or go back to play again.
view highscore is also visable.

* I will have to run the first question from a button like first step of taskinator
but this time there will be a question that changes over time.
Create variables to store the quiz questions
Use mouse-click events to start the quiz
Write for loops to cycle through quiz questions
Use key-press events to receive user input in the form of answers to quiz questions
Create a time limit for the game using time functions
Write conditional statements to determine wrong and right answers
Use client-side storage to store high scores

## User Story
